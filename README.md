The forked solution folder structure has been re-generated with angular-cli version 1.0.0-beta.32.3.
In order to use this code you have to generate a new project and copy the src folder content into it otherwise the node_modules and the other angular2 requirements are going to miss.

More info about angular-cli install:

project creation:
~ > ng new PROJECT_NAME
~ > cd PROJECT_NAME
~ > ng serve

In order to use this solution you have to use a back-end API which does the authentication via JSON message handling.
